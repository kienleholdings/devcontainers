# Dev Containers

ðŸš¢ A Selection of Containers from 
[`@microsoft/vscode-dev-containers`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers)
with some Kienle Holdings Additions.

## Introduction

In order to create a standardized development environment for every team, project, and person at
Kienle Holdings, we decided to leverage
[VS Code Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers). This allowed us to
instantly spin up fully-functioning development environments for any developer, and all they need
to do so is Docker. Speed of onboarding is very important in a fast-moving startup environment, and
we strive to create the best developer experience at Kienle Holdings.

The reason why we've "forked" some of these containers is simple: we don't like repeating 
ourselves. We got tired of typing out the same commands in each dev container and decided: "Hey,
why not build our own that has everything we need in it already?" And thus the `devcontainers` repo
was born.
